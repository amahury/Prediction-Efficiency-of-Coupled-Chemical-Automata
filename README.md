In the module folder there are python scripts containing the classes created to study four cases as a reservor: 
1. single oscillator,
2. two uncoupled oscillators,
3. two coupled oscillators with high coupling and
4. two coupled oscillators with low coupling. 

In the data folder there is a .csv file containing the time series generated using the Lorenz system, using the parameters indicated in the paper. 

The jupyter notebook miscellaneous contains code to obtain things like plots or visualizations. On the contrary, the notebook "results" contains all the experiments performed, 
which respective values can be consulted in the appendix of the final project report.
